        <item>Many great inventions are initially greeted with ridicule and disbelief. The invention of the airplane was no exception. Although many people who heard about the first powered flight on December 17, 1903 were excited and impressed, others reacted with peals of laughter. The idea of flying an aircraft was repulsive to some people. Such people called Wilbur and Orville Wright, the inventors of the first flying machine, impulsive fools. Negative reactions, however, did not stop the Wrights. Impelled by their desire to succeed, they continued their experiments in aviation. \n\n Orville and Wilbur Wright had always had a compelling interest in aeronautics and mechanics. As young boys they earned money by making and selling kites and mechanical toys. Later, they designed a newspaper-folding machine, built a printing press, and operated a bicycle-repair shop. In 1896, when they read about the death of Otto Lilienthal, the brothers\&apos; interest in flight grew into a compulsion. \n\n Lilienthal, a pioneer in hang-gliding, had controlled his gliders by shifting his body in the desired direction. This idea was repellent to the Wright brothers, however, and they searched for more efficient methods to control the balance of airborne vehicles. In 1900 and 1901, the Wrights tested numerous gliders and developed control techniques. The brothers\&apos; inability to obtain enough lift power for the gliders almost led them to abandon their efforts. \n\n After further study, the Wright brothers concluded that the published tables of air pressure on curved surfaces must be wrong. They set up a wind tunnel and began a series of experiments with model wings. Because of their efforts, the old tables were repealed in time and replaced by the first reliable figures for air pressure on curved surfaces. This work, in turn, made it possible for the brothers to design a machine that would fly. In 1903 the Wrights built their first airplane, which cost less than $1,000. They even designed and built their own source of propulsion-a lightweight gasoline engine. When they started the engine on December 17, the airplane pulsated wildly before taking off. The plane managed to stay aloft for 12 seconds, however, and it flew 120 feet. \n\n By 1905, the Wrights had perfected the first airplane that could turn, circle, and remain airborne for half an hour at a time. Others had flown in balloons and hang gliders, but the Wright brothers were the first to build a full-size machine that could fly under its own power. As the contributors of one of the most outstanding engineering achievements in history, the Wright brothers are accurately called the fathers of aviation.</item>

        <item>In the 16th century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration, Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king\&apos;s favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain. \n\n A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan. \n\n One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan\&apos;s men died of starvation and disease. \n\n Later, Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge. \n\n</item>

        <item>Direction:(Q.14-Q.20)- Read the following passage and answer the questions given below:\n\n Marie Curie was one of the most accomplished scientists in history. Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered radium, an element widely used for treating cancer, and studied uranium and other radioactive substances. Pierre and Marie\&apos;s amicable collaboration later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom. \n\n Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master\&apos;s degree and doctorate in physics. \n\n Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress. \n\n Curie\&apos;s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world. \n\n</item>

        <item>Direction:(Q.1-Q.7)- Read the following passage and answer the questions given below:\n\n Mount Vesuvius, a volcano located between the ancient Italian cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, has received much attention because of its frequent and destructive eruptions. The most famous of these eruptions occurred in A.D.79.\n\n The volcano had been inactive for centuries. There was little warning of the coming eruption, although one account unearthed by archaeologists says that a hard rain and a strong wind had disturbed the celestial calm during the preceding night. Early the next morning, the volcano poured a huge river of molten rock down upon Herculaneum, completely burying the city and filling the harbor with coagulated lava.\n\n Meanwhile, on the other side of the mountain, cinders, stone and ash rained down on Pompeii. Sparks from the burning ash ignited the combustible rooftops quickly. Large portions of the city were destroyed in the conflagration. Fire, however, was not the only cause of destruction. Poisonous sulfuric gases saturated the air. These heavy gases were not buoyant in the atmosphere and therefore sank toward the earth and suffocated people. Over the years, excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum have revealed a great deal about the behavior of the volcano. By analyzing data, much as a zoologist dissects an animal specimen, scientists have concluded that the eruption changed large portions of the area\&apos;s geography. For instance, it turned the Sarno River from its course and raised the level of the beach along the Bay of Naples. Meteorologists studying these events have also concluded that Vesuvius caused a huge tidal wave that affected the world\&apos;s climate.\n\n In addition to making these investigations, archaeologists have been able to study the skeletons of victims by using distilled water to wash away the volcanic ash. By strengthening the brittle bones with acrylic paint, scientists have been able to examine the skeletons and draw conclusions about the diet and habits of the residents. Finally, the excavations at both Pompeii and Herculaneum have yielded many examples of classical art, such as jewelry made of bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius and its tragic consequences have provided everyone with a wealth of data about the effects that volcanoes can have on the surrounding area. Today, volcanologists can locate and predict eruptions, saving lives and preventing the destruction of other cities and cultures.\n\n</item>

        <item>Direction:(Q.1-Q.7)- Read the following passage and answer the questions given below:\n\n Conflict had existed between Spain and England since the 1570s. England wanted a share of the wealth that Spain had been taking from the lands it had claimed in the Americas. Elizabeth I, Queen of England, encouraged her staunch admiral of the navy, Sir Francis Drake, to raid Spanish ships and towns. Though these raids were on a small scale, Drake achieved dramatic success, adding gold and silver to England\&apos;s treasury and diminishing Spain\&apos;s supremacy. \n\n Religious differences also caused conflict between the two countries. Whereas Spain was Roman Catholic, most of England had become Protestant. King Philip II of Spain wanted to claim the throne and make England a Catholic country again. To satisfy his ambition and also to retaliate against England\&apos;s theft of his gold and silver, King Philip began to build his fleet of warships, the Spanish Armada, in January 1586. \n\n Philip intended his fleet to be indestructible. In addition to building new warships, he marshaled 130 sailing vessels of all types and recruited more than 19,000 robust soldiers and 8,000 sailors. Although some of his ships lacked guns and others lacked ammunition, Philip was convinced that his Armada could withstand any battle with England. \n\n The martial Armada set sail from Lisbon, Portugal, on May 9, 1588, but bad weather forced it back to port. The voyage resumed on July 22 after the weather became more stable. The Spanish fleet met the smaller, faster, and more maneuverable English ships in battle off the coast of Plymouth, England, first on July 31 and again on August 2. The two battles left Spain vulnerable, having lost several ships and with its ammunition depleted. On August 7, while the Armada lay at anchor on the French side of the Strait of Dover, England sent eight burning ships into the midst of the Spanish fleet to set it on fire. Blocked on one side, the Spanish ships could only drift away, their crews in panic and disorder. Before the Armada could regroup, the English attacked again on August 8. \n\n Although the Spaniards made a valiant effort to fight back, the fleet suffered extensive damage. During the eight hours of battle, the Armada drifted perilously close to the rocky coastline. At the moment when it seemed that the Spanish ships would be driven onto the English shore, the wind shifted, and the Armada drifted out into the North Sea.

        <item>A dangling modifier is a phrase or clause that is not clearly and logically related to the word or words it modifies.

    </array>
    <array name="common_mistake_explanation_dangling_modifier">
        <item></item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first sentence it does not provide the idea who find the article unconvincing, a case of dangling modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation: This sentence says that the experiment was trying to improve its own results. To revise, combine the phrase and the main clause into one sentence. The first sentence does not say who wanted to improve the result.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first sentence it does not specify who is looking toward the west. In fact, there is nothing at all in the sentence to which the modifying phrase looking toward the west can logically refer. Since the modifier, looking toward the west, is sitting next to the funnel shaped cloud, the sentence suggests that the cloud is doing the looking.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first sentence, placement of walking to the movies, this sentence suggests that the cloudburst is walking to the movies even though a possible walker - Arnav - is mentioned later.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first sentence it looks like, tree was driving.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first sentence, there is no \&apos;I\&apos; in the main clause, so the phrase \&apos;Putting on my pajamas\&apos; is technically modifying the subject of the main clause \&apos;a mouse\&apos;. Therefore, the situation in this sentence is pretty strange?the mouse is putting on the speaker\&apos;s pajamas.</item>
        <item>Explanation: It, of course, cannot add compounds to solutions, so the question of who did so remains.Often—though not always—we can rewrite the modifier and preserve the passive voice.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the 2nd sentence it shows clearly, that I (not my mother!) was nine years old when my mother enrolled in medical school.</item>
        <item>Explanation: Now the sentence means that the car (not Arnav) was fixed. It is again the case of dangling modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In this example, the modifier Having read your letter is modifying we as it should. Logically, the wrong example suggests the cat read the letter</item>
        <item>Explanation: In this example, the modifier Meticulous and punctual is modifying Aarav as it should, not Aarav\&apos;s work ethic.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In this example, the modifier Having seen Blackpool Tower is modifying she as it should, not the Eiffel Tower . Logically, the wrong example suggests the Eiffel Tower saw the Blackpool Tower.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the wrong example, it indicate that Ship\&apos;s crew is vicious and smelly. Again it is example of misplaced modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation: Who did the preparing? Implied subject = we/ researchers; grammatical subject = our focus</item>
        <item>Explanation: Who is using the data? Implied subject = we/researchers; grammatical subject = the effects</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first case, it is giving the meaning that parent is giving the gift in the childhood.</item>
        <item>Explanation: Was Arnav written in code? Again, the meaning of the sentence is ludicrous. And it is case of dangling modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation: It is again the case of dangling modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation: Did the ingredients prepare the meal? It is again the case of dangling modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation: In the first case,it gives the impression that book was running for the school bus?</item>
        <item>Explanation: The implied subject of drinking is \&apos;we\&apos; or \&apos;whoever\&apos; is in camp, but the actual subject is the \&apos;lions\&apos;. Correct this by making \&apos;we\&apos; the implied subject and actual subject,While drinking our coffee, we saw the lions approach our camp or by converting the gerund phrase into a clause, While we were drinking coffee, the lions approached our camp.</item>
        <item>Explanation: Your wallet doesn\&apos;t walk, but you do.</item>
        <item>Explanation: The coach was not the fine athlete and student.</item>
        <item>Explanation: As the view is only for the local audience.</item>

    <array name="common_mistake_explanation_modifier">
        <item>So,an adjective or an adverb are modifiers because they change the meaning or add detail to another word or words -- as in \&apos;the thin man (adjective) and the cowardly lion (adverb).\&apos; Thin and cowardly are the modifiers.</item>
        <item>A misplaced modifier is a word, phrase, or clause that is improperly separated from the word it modifies / describes. Because of the separation, sentences with this error often sound awkward, ridiculous, or confusing.</item>
        <item>Explanation:The fisherman left his live sack of bait on the dock.Live is the adjective modifier here, and it\&apos;s misplaced because it\&apos;s modifying the word sack, implying that the sack is alive. The intended meaning is for the bait to be live. So, the correct fix would be: The fisherman left his sack of live bait on the dock.</item>
        <item>Explanation:So, the modifier here is quickly, but it\&apos;s in the wrong location. As it\&apos;s written, it says that you saw the mutants quickly, not the speed with which you\&apos;re running from them. To fix this modifier, put the adverb back where it makes the most sense.</item>
        <item>Explanation:As written, it seems like the gunslinger, rather than coolly emptying his spent shells onto the ground is instead emptying himself onto the ground. Put the modifying phrase in the right place to make him a hero again.</item>
        <item>Explanation:Here, this sentence makes it seem as though Arnav\&apos;s presents were eagerly awaiting Arnav\&apos;s birthday. Since presents can\&apos;t exhibit the emotion of feeling eager, it is unlikely that this modifier is written correctly. The most logical explanation is that Mary was eagerly awaiting his own birthday.</item>
        <item>Explanation:Here, Aarav\&apos;s delight is being modified by the phrase tired of all of the nights in hotels. Unfortunately, Aarav\&apos;s delight can\&apos;t be tired of this because Aarav\&apos;s delight isn\&apos;t a person. Instead, it is more likely that Aarav himself is tired.It can be corrected by moving the proper subject next to the modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation:It is the example of misplaced modifier.</item>

        <item>Explanation:It is the example of misplaced modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation:It is the example of misplaced modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation:gold man\&apos;s watch is wrong modifier, it should be replaced by man\&apos;s gold watch.</item>
        <item>Explanation:cold dish of cerel is wrong modifier and it should be replaced by dish of cold cerel.</item>
        <item>Explanation:torn student\&apos;s book is wrong modifier and it should be replaced by student\&apos;s torn book.</item>
        <item>Explanation:Arun almost failed is wrong modifier and it should be replaced by Arun failed almost.</item>
        <item>Explanation:who laugh rarely is misplaced modifier and should be replaced by who rarely laugh.</item>
        <item>Explanation:There is wrong modifier in this case.</item>
        <item>Explanation:This first sentence,suggests that we brought a lunch slowly, case of wrong modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation:The first sentence, means that I only contributed the money, on correction, the sentence means that I contributed only Rs100.</item>
        <item>Explanation:In this case, we need to put the phrases next to the noun they are supposed to modify.</item>
        <item>Explanation:The first case is giving the meaning as corner is smoking pipe.</item>
        <item>Explanation:The first case gives the impression that house is made of barbed wire. It is case of misplaced modifier.</item>
        <item>Explanation:The first case is giving the meaning that a buttered woman is served dinner?</item>
